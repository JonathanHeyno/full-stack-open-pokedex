Let us assume a group of 6 people working on an app with Python. The linting would require a commonly agreed upon (or in some other way mandated) linting rules. If the group is part of a larger software company, is doing a project for a client, or has an established format from prior projects, it could adopt those linting rules, otherwise the group needs, or agree to them. Probably the best thing to do is to adopt rules from an established project or company. Pylint or Flake8 would be feasible choices for linting.

Testing would require agreeing on e.g. coverage and other metrics (unless again, they are mandated from e.g. client). Unit testing can be done with Pytest or Unittest. Python is interpreted so a build may not be required, but to make the program a standalone, PyInstaller could be used.

For a self-hosted environment, you could pick from a variety of solutions besides Jenkins, such as TeamCity or CircleCI. For cloud-based solutions there is also a wide array of services, such as TravisCI or AWS CodePipeline.

The decision between self-hosting and cloud-based depends first and foremost on the business environment. If the client, or organization you are working for determines one or the other, you go with that. Otherwise, given a small project group of 6 people, the app probably wonâ€™t be a large scale project so a cloud-based solution is more likely a better one, unless for some reason lots of resources are needed.
